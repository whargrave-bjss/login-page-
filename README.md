Login Page
The login page contains a form with fields for username and password. It validates input and displays error messages if validation fails. Upon successful login, it redirects to the user's account page.

Registration Page
The registration page contains a form with fields for username, email, password, and confirm password. It validates input and displays error messages if validation fails. Upon successful registration, it stores the user's information and logs them in automatically.

Form Validation
Both forms validate input by checking that:

Username and password fields are not empty
Password is at least 8 characters long
Email is in a valid format (for registration)
Passwords match (for registration)
Error messages are displayed if validation fails. Forms cannot be submitted until validation passes.

Responsive Design
The pages use responsive design to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience on any device.

Running the Project
To run this project, simply open the index.html file in a browser. The login page is the starting point.

Customize the HTML/CSS/JS as needed to build your own login and registration system.
